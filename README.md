# MeArm Robot ROS-Arduino Integration

This project showcases the integration of the MeArm robotic arm with ROS (Robot Operating System) using an Arduino as the intermediary controller. It demonstrates how to control the MeArm robot's servo motors through ROS topics and services, allowing for precise and flexible manipulation tasks.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to leverage the capabilities of ROS for high-level control while using Arduino for low-level hardware interfacing. This approach enables a modular and scalable system that can be extended for various robotic applications.

### Features

- Control MeArm servo motors through ROS messages.
- Set predefined poses for the MeArm using ROS services.
- Real-time manipulation and feedback through the integration of ROS and Arduino.
- Modular and scalable architecture suitable for educational purposes and robotic experiments.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
